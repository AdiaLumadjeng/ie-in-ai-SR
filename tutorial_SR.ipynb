    "\n",
    "Welcome to this tutorial on symbolic regression! Symbolic regression offers the unique advantage of creating inherently explainable models by uncovering mathematical expressions that describe data. Once a prominent technique, it has been overshadowed by more complex methods, making it an old and forgotten child of machine learning. However, recent advancements have rekindled interest in its capabilities.\n",

    "Symbolic regression stands out for its ability to produce models that are both accurate and interpretable. By revealing the underlying mathematical relationships in data, it allows for greater insight and understanding, making it a valuable tool in various fields. In this tutorial you will use and compare the following methods to discover relationships between datapoints.\n",
